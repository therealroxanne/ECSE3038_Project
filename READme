Internet of Things, or IoT, is the term used to describe a network of actual physical things or "things" that are linked to the internet and may 
communicate with one another to carry out specific functions.

A software system known as an IoT platform makes it possible to manage, install, and integrate IoT devices and data. It offers the required tools
for gathering and analyzing data produced by these devices, and it enables users to operate and monitor their IoT devices from a single location.

The objective of this project is to create an IoT platform that manages basic appliances that are traditionally managed by the flick of a switch, 
such as fans and air conditioners, as well as lighting appliances like lights and in-wall lighting fixtures.

1. Users should be able to designate a time after which the lights should turn on using an IoT platform capability. In that case, the IoT platform 
can only turn on the lights if the current time is later than the user-specified time.
2. Users should be able to define a temperature at which the fan should activate using the IoT platform's capability. A temperature sensor, such as 
a digital temperature sensor, coupled to the ESP32 and able to read the current temperature of the room, can be used to achieve this. If the current 
temperature is higher than the user-specified value, the IoT platform can then only turn on the fan in that case.
3.A sensor that can determine whether a person is present in the space should also be part of the IoT platform. For example, a passive infrared (PIR)
sensor that detects changes in infrared radiation that happen when a human walks within its field of vision can be used to achieve this. This data can 
then be used by the IoT platform to decide whether to turn on the lights.

COMBINED LOGIC
The controlled appliances should only switch on if each of the required conditions is satisfied using a combination of the temperature-based control, 
time-base control, and presence detection features of the IoT platform. 

Using logical programming that verifies the following, this can be achieved:

Consider both the data from the presence sensor and the current temperature before choosing whether to turn on the fan.
Consider the presence sensor data as well as the current time before choosing whether to turn on the lights.
